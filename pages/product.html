        <h2>African plantain</h2>
        A plantain to the untrained eye could easily be mistaken for a banana. In fact, it belongs to Musaceae, 
        the banana family of plants, and it's closely related to the common banana. Believed to be native to Southeast Asia, 
        plantains are grown in tropical regions around the world and in a variety of cuisines. Unripe plantains are green 
        to yellow, difficult to peel, and the fruit is hard with a starchy flavorâ€”this is the perfect stage for boiling and frying them. 
        When fully ripe, plantains are black, with a flavor that some people describe as similar to a banana but not as sweet.
        Most people prefer them cooked even at this stage.

        <h2>African yam</h2>
    Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers 
    (some other species in the genus being toxic).
    Yams are perennial herbaceous vines native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas and cultivated for the consumption 
    of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions. The tubers themselves, also called "yams", come 
    in a variety of forms owing to numerous cultivars and related species.

        <h2>African garden eggs</h2>
        African garden eggs are a nutritious fruit from the nightshade family and are widely consumed in African 
        countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Benin Republic. The botanical name of garden egg is Solanum melongena. 
        Although it is often referred to as a vegetable, it is technically a fruit, because they grow from a flowering 
        plant and contain seeds. Garden eggs can be used to make a variety of dishes, such as garden egg sauce, which 
        requires garden eggs, onions, tomatoes, red bell pepper, scotch bonnet pepper, garlic, ginger, and red palm oil.
